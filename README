# IRC Server and Client

## Overview

This project implements a basic version of an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server and client based on the RFC 2812 & 2813 specification. It allows multiple clients to connect to the server, join channels, send messages, and perform other IRC-related commands.

It also allows multiple servers to join in network and exchange private message between clients on different server and server to server communication.
## Files

- `server.c`: Contains the source code for the IRC server. It handles multiple client connections, channel management, and message forwarding.
- `client.c`: Contains the source code for the IRC client. It connects to the IRC server, sends commands, and displays messages from the server.
- `Makefile`: Used to compile the server and client programs easily.
- `client.conf`: A configuration file for the client that contains the server IP address and port number.
- `README.md`: This file, containing information about the project and how to run it.

## Compilation

To compile the server and client, use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make


./server server.conf

./client client.conf

OR DO IT MANUALLY

gcc -w  server.c -o server
./server server.conf

gcc -Wall client.c base64_utils.c -o client
./client client.conf


This README provides a basic guide to what each file in the project is for, how to compile the programs using the Makefile, and how to run the server and client manually.
